I inherited this file and it is a hot mess. the code has some documentation in it, but I cannot discern the issue. 
It currently seeems to run, i.e. no errors on running it, but no emails are generated.

The purpose of the file:
Every day I add items to the sheet in the tab labeled "Action Items" with the various fields filled in including Due date
Once a week I am supposed to run the macro in the attached text file. It creates an email based on the "Owner" field which cross references the email address in the mailinfo tab.
The macro creates an email for each owner, preaddressed and filled in with the subject and body
I review and send.
